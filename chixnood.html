        <b><u>Directions</u>:</b>
    </h3>    
        <h5>
            <ol>
                <li> Preheat a 2 gallon pot, and large dice celery, carrots, and onion (roughly 1/4" cubes)</li>
                <li> Saute mis en place: onions, then carrots, then celery. </li>
                <li> While mis is sauteing, cut chicken into strips or cubes as desired. Anything larger than 1/8" is fine, anything smaller will disappear into the broth. </li>
                <li> Once mis is tender, throw in chicken stock. Top off with water if needed. </li>
                <li> Allow to come to a light boil, and reduce flame to a simmer; throw in chicken.</li>
                <li> Once the chicken is cooked through, salt and pepper to taste. We will need to re-salt later, but this helps season everything evenly, including the pasta. </li>
                <li> Add pasta. Pick parsley leaves and wash. </li>
                <li> Once pasta is tender, re-season and serve. Garnish with parsley leaves. </li>
            </ol>
